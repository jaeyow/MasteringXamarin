This post is a short summary and a reminder to myself and others, of the [presentation](https://www.meetup.com/SydneyMobileDotNetDevelopers/events/233229471/) that I recently gave to the local Xamarin meetup. I have prepared [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16rtnAfWC_2qQ59FzC1fxHVtxYqY4dqEOsvc6ViGyf3M/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000&slide=id.p), please feel free to re-use as you please. I have also prepared a [demo](https://bitbucket.org/jaeyow/xamarinapp) in my bitbucket account. Also free for anyone to use.


__*Continuous Delivery*__ – Continuous Delivery is a software development discipline where you build software in such a way that the software can be released to production at anytime. – Martin Fowler

By now it is well established that Continuous Delivery is a big thing. We have large companies like Facebook, Google, Netflix and the like have been doing this for years in the web space.

__*Reduced Lead Time*__ – lead time is defined as the time between the generation of the idea, and the delivery of the app to the hands of the customer. Or it can be defined as the  time between the reporting of a bug, and the delivery of the fix to the customer.

__*Faster feedback*__ – Because of the realisation of reduced lead time, this naturally creates a faster feedback cycle. Faster feedback for customers, due to the reduced time between releases. Also faster feedback for developers – due to all the automation and monitoring. Developers will know quicker when things pass or fail.

__*Higher quality releases*__ – because your build is automated, you will get more predictable and higher quality results because you have done the release cycle so many times before.

__*Improve the team’s emotional wellbeing*__ – releasing often increases the team’s engagement and actually has a motivational effect. It gives the team a sense of achievement because the manual, tedious and repetitive work will be avoided, and can be replaced with tasks that add value for the customer.
