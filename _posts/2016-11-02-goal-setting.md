The title of this blog is __Mastering Xamarin__, and that is exactly my intention for the future, but first things first, I want to focus on the 6 months from today. They say a journey of a thousand miles start with a single step. So let us really take that bull by the horn. No, getting a physical certificate does not necessarily mean that one has mastered the subject matter, it simply means that one has gone through the course work required to cover the breath of the material. It does 'force' one to study topics that wouldn't have otherwise.

After having worked on a Xamarin Forms-based project with [mPort](https://mport.com/) for about a year I cannot say that I have mastered Xamarin just yet. The material is just too broad. To me, to Master Xamarin is to be proficient not only in Forms, but also the platforms in iOS and Android devices, and its use in Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android projects.

Now working for [Readify](https://readify.net/) is another thing altogether. When your employer is really encouraging you to learn new things, so much so that the Professional Development program entitles a developer to 20 days of training per year. That's just awesome so I plan to use these PD days on 2 technologies this year, I'm getting my Xamarin certification in 6 months. And will spend some quality time getting to know [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/) as well, since that is what we are using at [ING Direct](https://www.ingdirect.com.au/).
